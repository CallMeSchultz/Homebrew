	regExpSearch : /^chain(?=.*sickle).*$/i, // Required; regular expression of what to look for (i.e. now it looks for any entry that has the word "le" followed by the word "attack" in it, disregarding capitalization). If this looks too complicated, just write: /leattack/i

	name : "Chain Sickle", // Required; name of the weapon

	source : ["HB", 1], //required; the source and the page number. "HB" stands for homebrew. See the "Complete SourceList" for an overview of sources that are already defined. Or define a new source using the "Homebrew Syntax - SourceList.js". // This can be an array of arrays to indicate the things appears in multiple sources. For example, if something appears on page 7 of the Elemental Evil Player's Companion and on page 115 of the Sword Coast Adventure Guide, use the following: [["E", 7], ["S", 115]]

	list : "melee", //optional; by having this attribute, the attack will appear in the dropdown fields. It will be grouped according to what you enter.

These will always appear below all the weapons that are included in the sheet

Alternatives are "Cantrip", "Martial", "Natural" (= always proficient), "Other", "Spell", or "Improvised Weapons" // Alternatively, you can define a type yourself.

	damage : [1, 6, "piercing"], // Required; the damage it does. First entry is the amount of dice, second is the type of dice, and third is the damage type. This example is 2d4 worth of piercing damage. //if you want the amount of dice to be an amount determined by the Character Level, then put "C" as the first value. Alternatively, you can use "B" for the value minus 1 (such as with Green-Flame Blade)

	range : "Melee", // Required; the range of the weapon

	monkweapon : false, // Optional; whether or not the items counts as a monk weapon (true or false)

	dc : false, // optional, will make the To Hit field display a DC instead. This will overwrite the first value you put in Modifiers (only from v10 onwards)

	modifiers : [1, ""], // Optional; bonuses to: [to hit, to damage]; "" means ignore. These values are added to the corresponding Modifier/Blue-Text fields. // You can also enter the three-letter abbreviation of an ability score (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, or Cha), to have that ability's modifier added to it.
